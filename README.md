Tarsier is a collection of tools to build event-based algorithms. It is an header-only library.

  `echo '/usr/local/lib' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/naturalVision.conf > /dev/null`.
  - __OS X__: Open a terminal and execute the command `brew install premake`. If the command is not found, you need to install Homebrew first with the command<br />
